# Bush PI Robot Car - SnooPi -  get it?

![snoopi](snoopi.jpg)

### A.  First build SnooPi following the instructions below

1. [Lesson 1 Introduction to SnooPi](Lesson1_Intro_SnooPi.pdf)
1. [Lesson 2 Intro to Mecanum Wheels](Lesson2_Intro_Mecanum_Wheels.pdf)
1. [Lesson 3 Build SnooPi](Lesson3_Build_TurboPI.pdf)

### B.  Access SnoPi using Jupyter Notebooks and Test your build.

As before, clicking them will download to your laptop.  Drag these files one at a time to your folder in JupyterLab and run them by Shift-Clicking each cell from the top to ensure proper functioning.  If there is an error - stop and do not proceed until you have been able to fix it.   It will help to Shutdown All Kernels first before attempting to run the notebook. ***NOTE: Only one user can run the notebook at a time!!!***

First put the car on a small pedestal such that the car does not actually move (wheels should not touch the floor) before trying these notebooks below.  

1. [Activate SnooPi's Buzzer and Lights](assignments/student_rcBuzzerLEDTest.ipynb)
2. Make SnooPi Go
    - [Run Forward](assignments/student_rcForward.ipynb)
    - [Run Diagonal](assignments/student_rcSlant.ipynb)
    - [Spin in Place](assignments/student_rcSpin.ipynb)
    - [Drift in circles](assignments/student_rcSpin.ipynb)
    - [SnooPi can measure Distance using Sonar](assignments/student_rcSonar.ipynb)
    - [Move SnooPi's Head](assignments/student_rcServos.ipynb)
3. [SnooPi takes a picture](assignments/student_rcCamera.ipynb)
4. After the tests above are successful, you will do individual assignments per table below

### D.  Autonomous Action Jupyter Notebook - Obstacle Avoidance

In this assignment, We will attempt to program an Autonomous Action that SnooPi can take. In this case SnooPi will avoid obtacles on its path as it moves. In addition, we will add Video and Sonar to the SnooPi actions - a frame will be captured and a distance measurement made each time through the "while" loop!  We will walktrhough this code first.  

1.  Please take the same steps as you did previously, rename file and drag it to SnooPi's Jupyter Lab into your own notebook folder without any modifcations.  Make sure SnooPi can execute its autonomous actions to capture video, measure distance, and evasive action on encountering an obstacle.
        * [Download Obstacle Avoidance here, change filename by adding your name](assignments/student_rcAvoid.ipynb).  Then drag the notebook to SnooPi's JupyterLab student folder, rename it and edit for your autonomous action.
        * [You may also need this notebook](assignments/student_snoopiSTOP.ipynb) that allows you to STOP SnooPi if things go awry!
        
1. Each student will then incorporate one or more (or all) actions from the previous exercises in addition to the Obstacle Avoidance movement that SnooPi is already performing while displaying a video image from the camera.  Write additional code for at least one of the following:
    * SnooPi should stop before it runs into the obstacle.Make the buzzer emit a "beep-beep-beep" tone when an obstacle is encountered and keep "beep-beep-beeping".  When the obstacle is removed SnooPi should once again be on its way with Beeping stopped.  
    * SnooPi should stop before it runs into the obstacle.SnooPi should stop and move it's head from side to side when an obstacle is encountered and keep shaking it's head. When the obstacle is removed SnooPi should look forward once again be on its way.  
    * SnooPi shoud move with LEDs showing Green. SnooPi should stop before it runs into the obstacle. SnooPi should then change it's LEDs to Red. It should remain Red until the obstacle is removed.  SnooPi should resume moving with LEDs green when obstacle is removed. 
    * SnooPi should stop before it runs into the obstacle. It should then start moving sideways until the obstacle no longer blocks its path.  Then resume moving forward.
    * Demonstrate your code for SnooPi's autonomous action.

### E.  Autonomous Action Jupyter Notebook - Line Folowing

In this assignment, We will attempt to program an Autonomous Action that SnooPi can take. In this case SnooPi will follow a line (made by sticking blue tape to the floor in an oval circuit or another way closed shape) as it moves. In addition, we will add Video and Sonar to the SnooPi actions - a frame will be captured and displayed each time through the "while" loop!  We will walktrhough this code first.  

1.  Please take the same steps as you did previously, rename file and drag it to SnooPi's Jupyter Lab into your own notebook folder without any modifcations.  Make sure SnooPi can execute its autonomouis actions to capture video, and follow the line as it moves.
        
1. Each student will then incorporate one or more (or all) actions from the previous exercises:
    * Test SnooPi to see if Line Following works and make any adjustments to the line following sensor as needed.
    * Find a ay to stop SnooPi at the end of the first loop.  Yo ucan use one of the other actions to incorporate this into your code.
        Make modifications once again to fix the action if you see issues and try again.

    * [Download Line Follower code here, change filename by adding your name](assignments/student_rcLineFollower.ipynb).  Then drag the notebook to SnooPi's JupyterLab student folder, rename it and edit for your autonomous action.

    * [You may also need this notebook](student_snoopiSTOP.ipynb) that allows you to STOP SnooPi if things go awry!
